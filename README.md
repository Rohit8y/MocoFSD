# MocoFSD : Momentum contrast in Frequency &amp; Spatial Domain

Momentum contrast in Frequency and Spatial Domain (MocoFSD), which learns feature representation by combining the frequency and spatial domain information. Features learned by MocoFSD, outperform its self-supervised and supervised counterparts on two downstream tasks, fine-grained image classification,
and image classification.
